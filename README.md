# casio-micropython
Toy code written for the built-in Micropython interpreter on, for example, the Casio 9860 GIII.  It should also work on real Python 3.  To run this code with a real Python interpreter, either do that in the usual way, which might involve editing the file, or just run the Python interpreter and import the file you want to run, which is what the calculator will do when you try to run it there.

Included so far:

### MANDELB
Mandelbrot fractal generator, written on the calculator itself, using the built-in keyboard.  Comments were added later with a real keyboard.
