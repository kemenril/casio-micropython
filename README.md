# casio-micropython
Toy code written for the built-in Micropython interpreter on, for example, the Casio 9860 GIII.  Should also work on real Python 3.  To run this code with a real Python interpreter, you'll also have to set your system up to run it properly, or you'll have to run the Python 3 interpreter and just import it, which is what the calculator will do when you try to run it there.

Included so far:

### MANDELB
Mandelbrot fractal generator, written on the calculator itself, using the built-in keyboard.  Comments were added later with a real keyboard.
